/**
 * Represents a constructed SQL statement that is ready for execution.
 *
 * <p>{@code Query} is the result of building a query via the {@link QueryBuilder} or the
 * {@link QueryTemplate#query(StringTemplate)} method. It supports both DQL (Data Query Language) statements such as
 * SELECT, and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.</p>
 *
 * <p>For SELECT statements, results can be retrieved as streams, lists, single results, or optional results. The
 * result type can be raw {@code Object[]} arrays (columns in order) or mapped to a specific record type.</p>
 *
 * <p>For DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), use {@link #executeUpdate()} to execute the statement and obtain the
 * number of affected rows. For batch operations, use {@link #executeBatch()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>A query can also be converted to a {@link PreparedQuery} via {@link #prepare()}, which enables bind variable
 * usage, batch processing, and retrieval of generated keys.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Example: Execute a raw query</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<User> users = orm.query(RAW."""
 *         SELECT \{User.class}
 *         FROM \{User.class}
 *         WHERE \{User_.name} = \{"Alice"}""")
 *     .getResultList(User.class);
 * }</pre>
